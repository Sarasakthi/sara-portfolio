        <p>
          Hello! I’m Saraswathi Sakthikumar, a Full Stack Developer based in the
          Edmonton area. I’m passionate about building forward-thinking software
          and web applications that empower engineers and drive innovation. With
          solid experience in Web Development and Database Management, I thrive
          on solving complex problems and learning new technologies. I’m a quick
          learner, a strong team collaborator, and deeply believe in the power
          of technology to make a meaningful impact. Driven by a commitment to
          lifelong learning, I specialize in the .NET framework, JavaScript, and
          React. For me, web development is the perfect blend of creativity,
          logic, and endless opportunities to explore something new and that’s
          what keeps me inspired every day. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely
          find me reading, staying active, or enjoying quality time with my
          kids. My curiosity and passion for continuous improvement fuel my
          drive to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.
